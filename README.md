## Heya, my name is Anjanique M. I am currently learning my way through a tech bootcamp to become a 👩‍💻 full-stack web-developer ☕️

Ever since early 2022, coding has been my passion, and it drives me to grow professionally and as a person. I have learned to be patient, and determined, 
and to overcome my fear of failure. I have come to be able to explore my love for learning and problem solving in a way I have not had the chance to before. I enjoy
making cute and practical websites, knitting, reading, making pixel art, and thinking about outer space.

Anyway, here are some technology that I have had the pleasure of exploring thus far:

- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap 🅱️
- React ⚛️
- Node.JS
- Git & Github
- API's, JSON, & Postman             

I'm hoping to find my dream career, writin' code and makin' a difference.
