 Dear vistor,
 
 It's cool to think that you're visiting here. I hope your day has gone well, and I hope mine did, too.
 
 If you wanna know about me before speaking to me, here's what's to know:

 I am very open-minded, 
 
 in love with the mysterious, and my husband, 
 
 favorite color is purple.. or is it brown? Anyway, I'd rather color combinations over single colors (brown/blue/green, pink/brown, red/yellow/blue, etc)
 ,
 
 I love to read (can you guess my favorite genre?),
 
 I love to learn neat stuff.
 
 and most obviously, I like 2 code :)

 If you wanna chat my socials are linked in my bio!

 Otherwise, enjoy my codes.
  
with sincerity, 

 Anjanique Mackey ~
